# Problem

Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The relative order of the elements may be changed.

# Solution

again like the remove duplicates from sorted array use fast and a slow pointer the slow_pointer will indicate the position of array that is valid.
